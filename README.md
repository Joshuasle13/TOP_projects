What the name says 


Well this is my first project, I just started The Odin Project, I hope it's okay at least.



I made a page about some recipes that I knew, used the link in TOP to get to allfoods so I could have the right information.


At the end I cleaned and organized the code a little.


And that's pretty much it.


You can have a more detailed look, if I'm not wrong, to the commits in the repository,
I tried to make atomic commits, I'll get better doing them.

I really enjoyed doing this, and I'm looking forward to keep learning about it.

Made some mistakes along the way, but who doesn't?,I mean look,I made a list not using the elements required to do a list, as you can imagine. (I had a laugh ngl)
nothing was really organized.

I was nervous, but I was doing the thing, and in the end it worked out.


It wasn't hard, I just needed to focus a little
