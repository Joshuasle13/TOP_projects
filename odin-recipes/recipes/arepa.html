    <h1>Arepas</h1>

     <h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li> ½ cups lukewarm water</li>2
    
   <li> 1 teaspoon salt</li>

    <li>2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N.®)</li>

    <li>¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
</ul>

     <h2>Directions</h2>
<p>
    It's not rocket science, and anyone can make it. <br>
    So let's begin.
</p>

<br>

<ul>


<li>
    <strong>Step 1</strong>
    <br>
    Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough. 
</li>

<br>

<li>
     <strong>Step 2</strong>
     <br>
     Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty. 
     <br> 
     (Just make a circle with the dough, take your index finger as a reference of how thick it must be)
</li>

<br>

<li>
     <strong>Step 3</strong>
     Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle. 
     <br>
     (Grilling or smoking them is possible with just a lid covering them.Also you can deep-fry them, just make sure to make a hole in the middle of the dough ;D iykyk)
</li>

<br>

<li>
     <strong>Step 4</strong>
     <br>
     Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket. 
</li>

<br>

<li>
     <strong>Step 5</strong>
     you can fill them with pretty much anything really, if you think about it, it's almost like bread ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
     <br>
     (if you have chicken, mayonnaise, avocado and purple onion, you can make something called 'Reina pepiada' in its most simple and basic form )
</li>

</ul>
