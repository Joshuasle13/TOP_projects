    <h1>Arepas</h1>

    <p>Ingredients

    2 ½ cups lukewarm water

    1 teaspoon salt

    2 cups pre-cooked white cornmeal (such as P.A.N.®)

    ¼ cup vegetable oil, or as needed

    </p>
    
<p>
    It's not rocket science, and anyone can make it. <br>
    So let's begin.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Step 1</strong>
    <br>
    Stir water and salt together in a medium bowl; gradually stir in cornmeal with your fingers until the mixture forms a soft, moist, malleable dough. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Step 2</strong>
    <br>


Form dough into eight 2-inch diameter balls; pat each ball to flatten into a 3/8-inch-thick arepa patty. 
<br> (Just make a circle with the dough, take your index finger as a reference of how thick it must be)
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Step 3</strong>
    Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry arepas in batches until golden brown, about 4 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer cooked arepas to a paper towel-lined plate to drain until cool enough to handle. 
    <br>
    (Grilling or smoking them is possible with just a lid covering them.Also you can deep-fry them, just make sure to make a hole in the middle of the dough ;D iykyk)
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Step 4</strong>
    <br>
    Slice halfway through each arepa horizontally with a thin serrated knife to form a pita-like pocket. 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Step 5</strong>
    <p>

you can fill them with pretty much anything really, if you think about it, it's almost like bread ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
<br>
(if you have chicken, mayonnaise, avocado and purple onion, you can make something called 'Reina pepiada' in its most simple and basic form )
