    <h1>Cereal</h1>

    <p>I just can't get enough of it</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>cereal(I'm a simple man so cornflakes it is )</li>
    <li>milk</li>
    <li>sugar</li>
    <li>
    You can add some fruits, like strawberries 
     and bananas.(Too healthy for me, but yeah, go nuts, I don't care) 
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
<li>Put the cereal in a bowl </li>
<li>put some milk in it</li>
<li>make it sweet to your taste with sugar</li>
</ol>

<p>Anyway, this is just a recommendation, don't let it sit for to long, well unless you like that mushy mess. (I'm not judging, just saying)
    <br>
   Don't be like me, I know I'll die from diabetes, but <em>you don't have to</em> so be careful with it. </p>
