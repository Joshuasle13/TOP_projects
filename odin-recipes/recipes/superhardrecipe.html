        <h1>Cereal</h1>

    <p>I just can't get enough of it</p>

         <h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
     <li>cereal(I'm a simple man so cornflakes it is )</li>
     <li>milk</li>
     <li>sugar</li>
     <li>
        You can add some fruits, like strawberries 
        and bananas.(Too healthy for me, but yeah, go nuts, I don't care) 
     </li>
</ul>

         <h2>Directions</h2>

<ul>

<li> 
    <strong>Step 1</strong>
    <br>
    Put the cereal in a bowl 
</li>

<br>

<li>
    <strong>Step 2</strong> 
    <br>
    put some milk in it
</li>

<br>

<li>
    <strong>Step 3</strong> 
    <br>
    make it sweet to your taste with sugar
</li>

</ul>
<br>

<p>Anyway, this is just a recommendation, don't let it sit for to long, well unless you like that mushy mess. (I'm not judging, just saying)
    <br>
 Don't be like me, I know I'll die from diabetes, but <em>you don't have to</em> so be careful with it.
